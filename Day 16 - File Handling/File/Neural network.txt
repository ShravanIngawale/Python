A neural network is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain, composed of interconnected artificial neurons organized in layers to process data and identify patterns.These networks learn from examples by adjusting the strength of connections (weights) between neurons to make accurate predictions.A neural network consists of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in the brain.
